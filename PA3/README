File List
___________________

multi-lookup.c - This is the main function which has 3 parts, a main, a requester thread, and a
resolver thread. 

The main does a bunch of checks and see if the information given exceeds any of the max
numbers and fixes the situation. It then calls the requester and resolvers and waits till they are
done to complete. 

Requesters takes the file and reads it, and if there is no file to read, it goes and helps with other 
files. It then reads to the buffer. Once all the files have been read, it prints how many files it had
worked to a service file. 

Resolvers checks to see if the queue is empty and if the there are still requesters working.
It then reads from the queue, gets the ip address if available, and writes to the results. 

multi-lookup.h - This files holds 3 structures which are used through out multi-lookup.c. A Global
structure which holds all varibles needed for seperate function. A reqThread strucutre which holds all
information for the requester and same the resolver struct does the same but for the resolver. 

How to Build
___________________

There are very few steps in order to build the files. Simply run the terminal, and type the 
command "gcc queue.c multi-lookup.k -Wall -Wextra". That will compile the program, which then can
then be ran by calling the function with "./a.out (# of requesters) (# of resolvers) (service file)
(results file) files to be read". Results file will hold the website along with the ip address and 
service shows the number of files each thread worked on.
