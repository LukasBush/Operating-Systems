File Information:
-----------------
arch/x86/kernel/cs3753_add.c - The system call program that takes the two input
values along with pointer integar that will hold the sum of the two inputs
and adds them together and puts them in the pointer to the sum.

arch/x86/kernel/Makefile - This file contains the instructions that is needed
to compile and build the system calls and kernel. 

arch/x86/entry/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl - This file contains the system
call table, in which we were able to add our two functions to it, rebuild it,
and have it as a system call.

include/linux/syscalls.h - This is a header file that allows us to link all our
test programs to our system calls allowing us to test them to make sure 
they work properly.

/var/log/syslog - This file contains the system log

Testing.c - Test the function call for helloworld, returning a -1 if the system
call fails and 0 if it works.

TestingAdd.c - Tests the function by plugging two inputs and the address of the
where the sum will be stored into the system call cs3753_add.c and then prints
the value of the sum after the system call has been called and worked on it.

Instructions to Build:
----------------------
When running the test program for cs3753_add.c, it goes through some very
simple steps. It first initializes 3 values, num1 and num2 are the two values
that will be added together and sum is the place where the return sum from the 
system call is returned to. It then proceeds to call the system call, inputing
num1, num2, and the address to sum. It then takes that information to the
system call in which it adds the two values together, puts the value in the
pointer to the sum value in which it replaces it, and then returns 0 stating
that it works. It then returns to the test program where it prints out sum 
showing that the sum of the two values is in there and then exits.
