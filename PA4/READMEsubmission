How to Build
___________________
Building the file is rather simple. Go to the location in which all the files are located and run
the terminal from there. Type the command "make" and it will make all the files for you. To test,
type "./test-" and then which file you want to test. You can either test predict or lru in which you
would type "predict" or "lru".
